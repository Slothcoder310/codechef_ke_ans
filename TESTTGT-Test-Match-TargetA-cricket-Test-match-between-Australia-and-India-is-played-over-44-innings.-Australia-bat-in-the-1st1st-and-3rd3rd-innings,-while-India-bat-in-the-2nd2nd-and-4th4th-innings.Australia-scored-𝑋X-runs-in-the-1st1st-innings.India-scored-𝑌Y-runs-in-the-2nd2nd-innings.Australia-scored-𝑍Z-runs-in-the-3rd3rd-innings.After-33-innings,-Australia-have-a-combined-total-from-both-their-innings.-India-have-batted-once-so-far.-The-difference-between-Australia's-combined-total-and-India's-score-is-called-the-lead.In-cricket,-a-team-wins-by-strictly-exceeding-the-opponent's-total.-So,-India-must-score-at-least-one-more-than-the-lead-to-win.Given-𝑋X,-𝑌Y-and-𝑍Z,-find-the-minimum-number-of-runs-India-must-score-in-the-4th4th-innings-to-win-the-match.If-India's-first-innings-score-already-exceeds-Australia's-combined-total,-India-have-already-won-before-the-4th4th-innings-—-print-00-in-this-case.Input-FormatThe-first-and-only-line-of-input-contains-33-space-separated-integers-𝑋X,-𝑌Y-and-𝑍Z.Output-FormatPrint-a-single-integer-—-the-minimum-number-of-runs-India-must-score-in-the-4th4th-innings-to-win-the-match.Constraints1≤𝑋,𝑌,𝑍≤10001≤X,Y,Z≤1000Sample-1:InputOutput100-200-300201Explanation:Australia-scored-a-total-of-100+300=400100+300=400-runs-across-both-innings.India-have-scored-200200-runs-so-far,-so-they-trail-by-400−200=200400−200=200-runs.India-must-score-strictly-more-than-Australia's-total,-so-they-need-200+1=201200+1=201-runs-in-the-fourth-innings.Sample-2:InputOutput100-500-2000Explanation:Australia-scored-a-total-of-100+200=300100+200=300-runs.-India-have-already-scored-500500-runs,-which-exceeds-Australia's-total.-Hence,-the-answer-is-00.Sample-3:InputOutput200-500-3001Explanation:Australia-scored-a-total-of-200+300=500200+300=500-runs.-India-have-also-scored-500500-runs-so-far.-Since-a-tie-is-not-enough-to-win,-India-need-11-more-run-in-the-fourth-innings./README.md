After 
3
3 innings, Australia have a combined total from both their innings. India have batted once so far. The difference between Australia's combined total and India's score is called the lead.

In cricket, a team wins by strictly exceeding the opponent's total. So, India must score at least one more than the lead to win.

Z, find the minimum number of runs India must score in the

If India's first innings score already exceeds Australia's combined total, India have already won before the

Sample 1:
Input
Output
100 200 300

201

Explanation:

Australia scored a total of 
100
+
300
=
400
100+300=400 runs across both innings.
India have scored 
200
200 runs so far, so they trail by 
400
−
200
=
200
400−200=200 runs.
India must score strictly more than Australia's total, so they need 
200
+
1
=
201
200+1=201 runs in the fourth innings.

Sample 2:
Input
Output
100 500 200

0

Explanation:

Australia scored a total of 
100
+
200
=
300
100+200=300 runs. India have already scored 
500
500 runs, which exceeds Australia's total. Hence, the answer is 
0
0.

Sample 3:
Input
Output
200 500 300

1

Explanation:

Australia scored a total of 
200
+
300
=
500
200+300=500 runs. India have also scored 
500
500 runs so far. Since a tie is not enough to win, India need 
1
1 more run in the fourth innings.</a></h2><h4>Difficulty: </h4>
